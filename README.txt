List of scripts:
1) maze.py          	- provided maze environment
2) evaluation.py	- provided evaluation functions
3) value_plot.py	- provided plotting functions
4) MazeProblem.py	- main script for Maze problem

5) DeepQNetwork.py		- DQN implementation
6) Reinfoce.py			- REINFORCE implementation for discrete actions
7) ReinforceContinuous.py	- REINFORCE implementation for continuous actions

8) Acrobot_Learn.py			- main script for Acrobot
9) MountainCar_Learn.py			- main script for MountainCar
10) MountainCarContinuous_Learn.py	- main script for MountainCarContinuous


2. To run the test, simply run the main scripts listed above. There will be prompts with instructions for you to choose the algorithms.

3. Feel free to play with the hyper-parameters

4. IMPORTANT: DQN and REINFORCE are implemented under TensorFlow 1.5.0 (no GPU required). Please make sure you have the proper dependencies.
